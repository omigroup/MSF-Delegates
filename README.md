# OMI MSF Delegates Shared Repo (Draft) 

## About: 
MSF Delegates is a group of volunteers within the Open Metaverse Interoperability group. We represent OMI Group interests as a Standards Development Organisation (SDO) and as a Principal Member within Metaverse Standards Forum (MSF) through voting. The group also acts as a conduit for the exchange of information between the two organisations; meeting regularly to review, discuss and share key developments and opportunities. 

## Reasons to get involved: 
- MSF membership comprises 1600+ members committed to create open standards for the Metaverse
- A unique opportunity to shape the development of this space 
- Make new connections and find speaking engagements

## How you can get involved: 
- MSF Delegates currently meet weekly on Wednesdays at 15:00 UTC to review the outputs of MSF meetings occuring throughout the week.  
- We track active tickets with our [Github Projects Kanban Backlog](../../projects/1?add_cards_query=is%3Aopen)
- We organise our backlog using github [Milestones](../../milestones) which makes it easy to track progress based on desired outcomes and objectives.
