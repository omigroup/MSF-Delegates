# OMI MSF Delegates Shared Repo (Draft) 

## About: 
The OMI Delegates are a group within the Open Metaverse Interoperability group, who have volunteered to represent OMI and engange with the Metaverse Standards Forum (MSF). Not exactly a working group, but this group does meet regularly to discuss MSF, and share out updates. 

## How you can get involved: 
- The delegates meet every Wednesday at 15:00 UTC to share out recent findings from the MSF event that occurs weekly at 14:00 UTC. 
- We track our active tickets with our [Github Projects Kanban Backlog](../../projects/1?add_cards_query=is%3Aopen)
- We organize our backlog with intent using github [Milestones](../../milestones) which makes it easier to track progress based on desired outcomes and objectives. Our first milestone is kicking off this repo! 
- We discuss our efforts using Discord, in the `#MSF-Delegates` channel. 
- Any questions? Contact the designated working group lead(s) @humbletim.

- We will / or will not be recording our meetings and you can or can not find those meeting recordings here
