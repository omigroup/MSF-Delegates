## (Draft) MSF delegate participation / scope of work:

As members the Open Metaverse Interoperability Group (OMI) and Metaverse Standards Forum delegates, we will represent the interests of the OMI community by

1. upholding the OMI’s group values, as stated on omigroup.org
2. communicating any standards creation, policymaking and other relevant actions of the Metaverse Standards Forum (MSF)
3. maintaining knowledge of OMI community needs by attending OMI meetings regularly [define 'regularly' at some point?]
4. maintaining knowledge of MSF activity by attending MSF meetings regularly
5. documenting MSF-related activity in the [MSF-Delegates repo](https://github.com/omigroup/MSF-Delegates) for the benefit of the OMI community
6. inquiring about OMI community needs through outreach (i.e., polls, discussions, etc.) as needed
7. fostering standards creation, policymaking and other relevant actions that support OMI’s group values as well as the overall values consistent with open metaverse goals
8. challenging standards creation, policymaking and other relevant actions that do not support OMI’s group values nor the overall values consistent with open metaverse goals
